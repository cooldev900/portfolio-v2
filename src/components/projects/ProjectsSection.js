                        <p>This project was one of my favourite tools for breaking my way out of tutorial hell ðŸ‘¹. I also wanted this project to serve me as a display of my JavaScript skills to potential employers or collaborators.</p>

                        <p>By the time I decided to start working on this project I had just finished learning about Promises, async...await, APIs and error handling. I wanted to code a project to implement all of this knowledge.</p>

                        <p>At the start, this project seemed simple, but it quickly got complicated, especially because I was dealing with three different APIs (and a couple more that didnâ€™t work in the end).</p>

                        <p>Doing courses and tutorials is great, but sometimes is difficult to evaluate how much are we actually learning. Watching video after video and coding along with the instructor gives us very good guidance, but it is not a realistic scenario. In a real-world job, we will have to solve problems and start figuring things out by ourselves (with the help of Google, of course ðŸ˜‰). So, to test how much I was actually learning during the JavaScript course I was doing I decided to make a simple To-Do app in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.</p>

                        <p>I underestimated CSS ðŸ˜…. The classes names are a bit funny and messy, so in the future, I'll try to implement BEM notation and maybe SASS.
